> <br> Go applications are organized in packages. A package is a collection of source files located in the same directory. All source files in a directory must share the same package name - name of the last directory in the import path. For ex: files in the "math/rand" => package rand
>
> When a package is imported, only entities (functions, types, variables, constants) whose names start with a capital letter can be used / accessed. The recommended style of naming in Go is that identifiers will be named using camelCase, except for those meant to be accessible across packages which should be PascalCase.
