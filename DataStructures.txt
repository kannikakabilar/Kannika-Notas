Data Structures

Primitive DS       - Predefined way of storing data (ex: int, char, float, double)
Non-Primitive DS   - It can store any set of values and even objects

  Linear DS        - elements stored sequentially
  Non-Linear DS    - elements connect to more than 1 elements (ie: trees, graphs)

  Static DS        - fixed size (ie: Arrays) 
  Dynamic DS       - can increase size as elements get inserted (ie: Linked List)


Arrays   -   indexing = O(1) but everything else O(n)

Linked Lists   -   inserting = O(1) but everything else O(n)

Stacks   -   used for evaluating math expr and recursive function calls

Hash Table

  Terms
    - Hash function: input is key-value and the output is memory address/slot# of where the element will be stored
    - Collision => chaining: when 2 elements are directed to the same slot use linked list or trees to store the element at that address
    - Open Addressing: store all values within the hash table
      - Linear Probing: if hash(x) % S is full => (hash(x) + 1) % S
