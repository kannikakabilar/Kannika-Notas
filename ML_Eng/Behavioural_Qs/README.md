# Behavioural Interview Qs

## When you don't know the answer to a technical Q

- I haven't worked with that (tool/software) yet but I'm keen to learn more about it.
</br> OR
- I haven't worked with that (tool/software) yet but with Copilot and ChatGPT, I'm confident I can pick it up quickly.
</br> OR
- I haven't worked with that (tool/software) directly but I have worked-on/knowleddge-of ... (talk about something similar or connecting to what they said)

## How would you learn a new tool/software?

1. I learn first from official documentation and tutorial videos
2. I apply what I learnt on a small project or an example
3. I also use tools like Copilot and ChatGPT which helps me learn concepts a lot faster
4. For deeper insights, I would ask colleagues and discuss in slack-channels

</br> (maybe think of an example)

## How would you handle a crash in the systems during non-working hours?

- Check logs to identify issue
- Take immediate action to prevent the situation from getting worse (ie: reverting a change or restarting)
- Contact stakeholders or key team members
- Document the incident
