# Behavioural Interview Qs

## When you don't know the answer to a technical Q

- I haven't worked with that (tool/software) yet but I'm keen to learn more about it.
</br> OR
- I haven't worked with that (tool/software) yet but with Copilot and ChatGPT, I'm confident I can pick it up quickly.
</br> OR
- I haven't worked with that (tool/software) directly but I have worked-on/knowleddge-of ... (talk about something similar or connecting to what they said)

## How would you learn a new tool/software?

1. I learn first from official documentation and tutorial videos
2. I apply what I learnt on a small project or an example
3. I also use tools like Copilot and ChatGPT which helps me learn concepts a lot faster
4. For deeper insights, I would ask colleagues and discuss in slack-channels
</br> (maybe think of an example)

## How would you handle a crash in the systems during non-working hours?

- Check logs to identify issue
- Take immediate action to prevent the situation from getting worse (ie: reverting a change or restarting)
- Contact stakeholders or key team members
- Document the incident

# Resume Qs

## Can you explain more about what you did for the following points?

> Presented a machine learning project on predictive modeling using Scikit-learn's KMeans implementation at the UIUC Big Data 2025 Conference, showcasing insights into user engagement patterns.
1. Presented a machine learning project
2. predictive modeling
3. Scikit-learn's KMeans implementation
4. UIUC Big Data 2025 Conference
5. showcasing insights into user engagement patterns

> Achieved the highest grade in courses Data Mining (with 97%) and Data Cleaning (with 109%) among all enrolled students, excelling in data transformation, outlier detection, feature engineering, and clustering.
1. data transformation
2. outlier detection
3. feature engineering
4. clustering

## Can you explain what you learnt about Machine Learning either in your undergrad and/or your master's program?

During my undergrad, I gained a strong understanding of the foundational concepts
1. supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning
2. Different types of models from linear methods to neural networks
3. loss functions, optimization technique: gradient descent
4. bias-variance tradeoff

In my master's program, I learned more advanced concepts in Machine Learning
1. Decision Trees
2. Naive Bayes' probabilistic models
3. Neural networks in depth: backpropagation, architectures and deep learning: CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs
4. Stochastic optimization techniques (SGD variants, momentum)
5. Model evaluation, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning
