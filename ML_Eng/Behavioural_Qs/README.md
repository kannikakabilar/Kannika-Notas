# Behavioural Interview Qs

## When you don't know the answer to a technical Q

- I haven't worked with that (tool/software) yet but I'm keen to learn more about it.
- --OR--
- I haven't worked with that (tool/software) yet but with Copilot and ChatGPT, I'm confident I can pick it up quickly.
- --OR--
- I haven't worked with that (tool/software) directly but I have worked-on/knowleddge-of ... (talk about something similar or connecting to what they said)

## How would you learn a new tool/software?

1. I learn first from official documentation and tutorial videos
2. I apply what I learnt on a small project or an example
3. I also use tools like Copilot and ChatGPT which helps me learn concepts a lot faster
4. For deeper insights, I would ask colleagues and discuss in slack-channels
- (maybe think of an example)

## How would you handle a crash in the systems during non-working hours?

- Check logs to identify issue
- Take immediate action to prevent the situation from getting worse (ie: reverting a change or restarting)
- Contact stakeholders or key team members
- Document the incident

Talk about your work in courses ...

## Can you explain what you learnt about Machine Learning either in your undergrad and/or your master's program?

During my undergrad, I gained a strong understanding of the foundational concepts
1. supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning
2. Different types of models from linear methods to neural networks
3. loss functions, optimization technique: gradient descent
4. bias-variance tradeoff

In my master's program, I learned more advanced concepts in Machine Learning
1. Decision Trees
2. Naive Bayes' probabilistic models
3. Neural networks in depth: backpropagation, architectures and deep learning: CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs
4. Stochastic optimization techniques (SGD variants, momentum)
5. Model evaluation, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning

# Resume Qs - Oracle

> Recognized for displaying business and system insights on a Tableau dashboard for stakeholders to grasp key metrics at a glance by streamlining data retrieval from Oracleâ€™s database using Python and Shell Scripting.

1. Worked on building a Tableau dashboard to display business metrics and system insights
2. Streamlined data retrieval from Oracle's database using Python scripting

> Optimized and wrote over 80 SQL queries for data extraction workflows using the Oracle Data Integrator API resulting in 35% runtime reduction of the data pipelines and implemented parameterized-interfaces for scalability.

1. Wrote many SQL queries for data extraction workflows
2. implemented parameterized interfaces to adjust for scalability

> Automated business processes by developing SuiteScripts

> Developed REST and SOAP API web services to external Power BI, Boomi, and Snowflake systems - to facilitate data exchange

# Resume Qs - CLEO

> Eliminated post-release issues completely through extensive testing of CLEO's legal documentation software and from collaborative discussions with developers, using Python and Selenium for automating quality assurance.

1. Used Python and Selenium to automate browser actions to test CLEO's software

> Coordinated the structure of CI/CD pipelines in GitHub Actions to include integration and regression testing of applications improving the release and developer feedback process by 70%.

1. Organized the structure of GitHub Actions yaml file to indicate integration/regression test results

> Designed and executed stress load tests using AWS CloudWatch and AWS Load Balancer by analyzing the system's performance under high traffic conditions to reduce latency by 40% under peak workloads.

1. AWS CloudWatch for ...
2. AWS Load Balancer for ...

> Implemented test data management using Docker for isolated test environments and Kubernetes for orchestrating on-demand test data services, allowing consistent datasets to be used across pipelines eliminating flakiness.

1. Setup isolated docker container with data needed for testing
2. Use consistent datasets with Kubernetes (package seeded database in pods) to prevent random test failures
